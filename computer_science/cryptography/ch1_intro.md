# Introduction

## Security Goals
- Confidentiality (Protecting confidential informtaion)
    - Snooping, Traffic analysis
- Integrity (Information to be changed constantly, change only made by authorized entities & mechanisms)
    - Modification, Masquerading, Replaying, Repudiation(sender of receiver later deny that she has sent/received the message)
- Availability (Information should be available to authorized entities)
    - Denial of service
    
## Services and Mechanisms
### Security Services
- Data confidentiality
- Data Integrity: Anti-change, Anti-replay
- Authentication: Peer entity, Data origin
- Nonrepudation: Proof of origin, Proof of delivery
- Access control

### Security Mechanisms
- Encipherment: hiding/covering data (confidentiality: cryptography/steganography)
- Data integrity: a short checkvalue created from the data itself
- Digital signature: the sendes/receiver can electronically sign/verify the signature
- Authentication exchange: two entities exchange messages for identification
- Traffic padding: insert some fake data to invalidate traffic analysis
- Routing control
- Notarization: set third party control center
- Access control: passwords, PINs

## Techniques
### Cryptography
### Steganography
